## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a fully functional e-commerce store using Django. The goal is to learn the fundamentals of Django development while building a real-world application that includes:

- Shopping cart management
- User management (registration, login, password management, email verification)
- Payment integration with PayPal
- Deployment to AWS or Render
- AWS integration (Amazon S3 for file storage, Amazon RDS for database management)
- Shipping and order functionality
- Styling and validation with Bootstrap

## Features

- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add items to their cart, update quantities, and proceed to checkout.
- **User Management**: Users can register, log in, and manage their account.
- **PayPal Integration**: Payment processing with PayPal.
- **Order Processing**: Orders are tracked and users are notified via email.
- **Email Verification**: Confirmation emails to verify user registrations.
- **AWS Integration**: Storage, database, and hosting integration with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
- **Deployment Options**: Deployed on Amazon Elastic Beanstalk or Render.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Web framework for Python to build the e-commerce platform.
- **PayPal API**: For integrating payment functionality.
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: For cloud storage (Amazon S3), database management (Amazon RDS), and deployment (Elastic Beanstalk).
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For frontend design and user interaction.
- **Bootstrap**: To enhance the user interface with responsive, mobile-first design.
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: For deployment and hosting of the application.
- **Amazon S3**: For file storage.
- **Amazon RDS**: For database management.

## Project Breakdown

This project is designed for learning purposes and follows a course structure that allows you to progressively build a live e-commerce store. The course covers:

- **Building an E-commerce Store**: Set up a Django project and create an online store.
- **Payment Integration with PayPal**: Implement payment processing.
- **Real-World Application Development**: Build a working e-commerce application.
- **Shopping Cart Development**: Create and manage a shopping cart.
- **User Management**: Implement registration, login, and profile management.
- **Email Verification**: Add email verification to enhance security.
- **AWS Integration**: Utilize AWS services for hosting and storage.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the application to a live server (AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Render).
- **Shipping and Order Functionality**: Handle order processing and shipping.
- **Styling and Validation**: Enhance the UI and ensure data validation.
- **Password Management**: Securely manage user passwords.

## Installation Instructions

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaheshDollu/django-ecommerce-store.git
   cd django-ecommerce-store



## Deployment
Deployment is the process of taking your application from your local machine to a live server where it can be accessed by users. There are different options available for deploying a Django application, and in this project, we have two primary deployment options: AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Render.

**AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service provided by Amazon Web Services that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale web applications and services. It supports Django applications, and with minimal configuration, you can deploy your app on AWS's scalable infrastructure. By integrating AWS services like S3 (for file storage) and RDS (for database management), Elastic Beanstalk simplifies the management of the entire deployment stack.

**Render**: Render is a cloud hosting platform for web applications that automates deployment. It supports various frameworks, including Django. Render automatically builds, deploys, and scales your app. It's a great alternative for users who want a simpler deployment process and don't want to manage infrastructure themselves.

Choose one of these deployment options based on your needs and follow the respective deployment guides for detailed instructions.

## Additional Notes
**PayPal Developer Account**: To integrate PayPal payment functionality, you'll need a PayPal developer account. This allows you to obtain the credentials necessary for integrating the PayPal API into your e-commerce store. You can sign up for a PayPal Developer account here.

**AWS Configuration**: For AWS integration, you will need to have an AWS account and configure AWS credentials to interact with services like S3 and RDS. Ensure that your credentials are properly set up in your environment for seamless integration with AWS services.

**Security**: This project includes basic user authentication and password management. For a production environment, ensure you implement SSL encryption, secure the admin panel, and follow security best practices like using environment variables for sensitive data.

**Testing**: Before deploying your app to a live server, thoroughly test your application to ensure everything works as expected, including payment processing, user registration, and cart functionality.
